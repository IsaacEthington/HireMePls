# HireMePls
These are little things that I hope will make you want to interview me. Still growing. 

About the files:
  
  **camelcup.py** is a relaxed simulation of a board game my friend bought. 
    It simulates millions of games so now I have a better strategy to win. (It actually worked).
  
  **search.py** is a general graph search. 
    It takes properties of a search algorithm (what data structure, heuristic) and lets you create the basic searches easy.
