# HireMePls
These are little things that I hope will make you want to interview me. Still growing. 

About the files:
  
  camelcup.py is a relaxed simulation of a board game my friend bought. 
    It simulates millions of games so now I have a better strategy to win. (It actually worked).
  
  search.py is a general graph search. 
    It takes properties of a search algorithm (what data structure, heuristic)
    This lets you create the basic searches easy. 
    A* is as simple as    
      def aStarSearch(problem, heuristic=WhateverHeuristicYouWant):
        #Searches (shortestPath + heuristic(state) first
        return generalSearch(problem, PriorityQueue, heuristic)
